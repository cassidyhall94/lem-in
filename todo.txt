1. Map can consist thousands of rooms
2. You need start and end room
3. Find valid path from smallest to largest
4. Send all the ants from start to end in the most optimized way possible
5. Start and end rooms can hold unlimited amount of ants, but all other rooms rooms in between can only have one ant at a time
6. Choose the right path depending on how many ants you have


7. Load data from the file and save it into variable
8. Read and check data from loaded data to make generation data for future farm
9. Decode paths list into room names
10.Restore farm to defaults, when MakeStep in mode 1 is ended
11. Sort paths by length
12. Find all paths from start to end
13. Find all possible combinations without intersects
14. Check intersects between two paths
15. Check intersects between existing combination and path
16. Find best combination between all combinaitons and calculates best suitable path for each ant
17. Make maps
18. Generate farm based on generation data
19. Connect all rooms based on links from the file
20. Make list of ants with own path, current room and id
21. Make ants (from ants list) to move from start to end prints each ant step
